## Chapter 1. The Role of AI Product Managers

The first AI team I ever worked for was designing something special: smart home–
assistant devices that could understand a wide variety of accents, and even
recognize who was talking and what they were instructing the assistant to do. It
was the early days of voice assistants and smart homes. I had always been
interested in the conjunction of language and tech, and I knew many voice systems
didn’t really “get” different ways of speaking. The Speech team’s goal was to make
an AI that did.

That was a really complicated task. We wrangled enormous datasets, refined
algorithms, and spent months trying to figure out how to embed this technology
into user-facing products. Speech technologies, and more specifically, speech
recognition, enables machines to transcribe what humans are saying. Similarly,
text-to-speech synthesis gives computers the ability to “speak,” given written words
as an input.

I didn’t realize at first that I had found myself at the heart of AI and innovation.
This experience showed me the exciting world of AI product management.
The field of AI has existed for many decades. It originated back in the 1950s, when
scientists attempted to develop computers that would emulate the way human
brains work, and in particular when Alan Turing suggested that machines can also
be taught to reason, just like humans.
AI is a field of computer science that gives computers intelligence. It enables
machines to perform nontrivial cognitive tasks comparable to tasks humans can
perform, such as reasoning, sensing, speech processing, visual perception, problem-
solving, and most importantly, as Oracle notes, learning from data and adapting.
While AI is not new, hardware limitations had obscured its potential until recently.
The industry is only now starting to unlock the vast potential of AI, a breakthrough
made possible by leaps in chip technology, unprecedented computational power,
and an abundance of data. These advancements, coupled with sophisticated
algorithms and cutting-edge machine learning (ML) techniques, are setting the
stage for AI to reach capabilities that were previously unimaginable.
Organizations with vast amounts of data are in a unique position to embrace AI and
ML. They stand to gain a significant competitive advantage, both in their
operations (e.g., predictions that inform planning, such as for restocking
inventories or identifying the right price point) and in their offerings (unique,
smart solutions that offer personalization, recommendations, automation, content
generation, and more). Now more than ever, those organizations need professionals
who can understand AI and its potential, leverage it, and “serve” it to customers.
Today, AI is ubiquitous. It drives increasingly complex and consequential decisions,
such as college admissions and medical diagnoses. I write this in 2024, and in the
past year alone, AI has advanced tremendously with the emergence of generative AI,
a subtype of AI that produces content, sometimes abbreviated as “GenAI.”
This chapter introduces the business role of the AI product manager (AI PM). I’ll
discuss what distinguishes this role from regular product management and what
skill sets it requires. We’ll also explore the diverse landscape of AI, including how
AI products leverage different AI technologies, to give you a comprehensive view of
both the day-to-day work lives of AI PMs and the broader context in which they
operate.

### The Stages of AI Evolution
GenAI is often conflated with traditional AI, but in reality, it’s just one subset of a
larger, more complex AI landscape. This distinction is crucial to understanding AI’s
full potential, yet it’s a misconception I encounter daily. While GenAI has become a
hot topic and the technology has made remarkable strides recently, it is by no
means a replacement for traditional AI.
When we talk about “AI,” it’s important to clarify that this term encompasses a
range of technologies and approaches, each with its own specific set of use cases.
To assume that “AI” just refers to GenAI oversimplifies a vast, multifaceted field.
Modern-day AI is classified into four groups: traditional, generative, general
intelligence, and superintelligence.

Figure 1-1 highlights how these four types of AI vary in scope and capability,
illustrating an evolving landscape where AI ranges from specialized tasks to
broader, potentially transformative applications. The diagram emphasizes the
layered complexity of AI, showing how each category contributes uniquely to our
understanding and advancement of intelligent systems.

### Traditional AI (1950s–Present)
Traditional AI has a long history that began in the 1950s and represents AI’s
foundational technologies. These systems are designed to perform specific tasks
through rule-based or pattern recognition systems. Traditional AI includes some of
the most essential applications we interact with on a daily basis:
Vision

Traditional AI has made strides in computer vision tasks such as image
recognition, object detection, and face recognition. These technologies
enable systems to interpret and analyze visual inputs, forming the basis
for everything from photo tagging on social media platforms to advanced
medical imaging technologies that help doctors diagnose diseases.

### Speech
Speech recognition and speech-to-text technologies, such as those used in
voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, have been in development for decades.
These technologies convert spoken language into text, enabling machines
to respond to voice commands. Text-to-speech (TTS) systems, which do the
reverse, give computers the ability to speak in a humanlike manner.
Natural language processing (NLP)
NLP tasks such as language translation, sentiment analysis, and other tasks
using chatbots have brought significant breakthroughs. Think of Google
Translate or chatbots used in customer service; these rely on AI to
understand human language in a more sophisticated way than simple
keyword recognition.

### Robotics
Traditional AI in robotics has led to the development of industrial robots,
autonomous vehicles, and drones. These robots can perform complex tasks
such as assembly in manufacturing plants or navigating streets
autonomously.

### Data analysis
Traditional AI excels in predictive analytics, data mining, and pattern
recognition. It can analyze vast datasets and uncover hidden patterns,
allowing organizations to make data-driven decisions and automate
processes that once required human intuition.
Generative AI (Late 2010s–Present)
GenAI represents the more recent wave of AI innovation and has captivated the
public’s attention with its ability to create content. This content can be text,
images, video, or even music, but GenAI does not replace the tasks handled by
traditional AI. Instead, it opens up new dimensions:

### Content creation
The ability to generate media such as images, video, and text from a given
prompt is one of GenAI’s core strengths. Applications range from creative
arts (helping artists design graphics or write music) to business
(automatically generating product descriptions for ecommerce websites).

### Deepfakes
GenAI can also be used to create synthetic media, sometimes known as
deepfakes, which can convincingly mimic real people’s voices or
appearances. While this technology raises ethical concerns, it also has
legitimate applications in entertainment and simulation environments.
Personalized media
GenAI is being used to tailor content experiences to individuals. Platforms
such as Netflix and Spotify are using AI to suggest shows and music that
align with user preferences. This trend is reshaping media consumption,
making it more personalized than ever before.

### Design and art
AI tools such as DALL-E and Adobe Firefly assist artists in generating
concepts or mockups. These tools reduce the time to produce creative
work, empowering artists to focus on refining their ideas.

###Game development
GenAI is making games more interactive and dynamic by allowing game
developers to create procedurally generated worlds, characters, and
environments, making each player’s experience unique.
Artificial General Intelligence (2030s?)
Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the next frontier in AI research, and while we
are not there yet, it holds the promise of machines capable of understanding,
learning, and applying knowledge across a wide range of tasks—essentially
mimicking human cognitive functions:

### Problem-solving
AGI will be able to tackle complex, multidomain problems. Imagine AI
systems capable of medical diagnosis one moment and strategic business
planning the next.

### Research and development
In R&D, AGI could dramatically accelerate scientific discovery by
generating hypotheses, running simulations, and performing experiments
much faster than humans can.
Personal assistants
AGI could evolve today’s virtual assistants into highly capable systems that
can manage vast areas of daily life, from personal schedules to creative
problem-solving.

### Healthcare
AGI will likely make huge strides in healthcare, offering personalized
medicine, diagnosing complex conditions, and even proposing novel
treatments.
Artificial Superintelligence (~2040s?)
Artificial superintelligence (ASI), while currently hypothetical, would surpass
human intelligence, providing solutions to problems that are not even within our
conceptual grasp today:

### Solving global challenges
If ASI becomes a reality, it could provide revolutionary solutions to large-
scale problems such as climate change, world hunger, and geopolitical
conflicts. ASI could offer new strategies to solve humanity’s most pressing
problems.

### Reliable foresight
Many of the decisions people make today are data driven. For example,
weather forecasts are made based on thousands of historical data points.
With ASI, future forecasts, whether they’re for predicting weather or
predicting changes in market pricing, will be more accurate.

### Advanced space exploration
Space missions and, potentially, interstellar colonization could be powered
by the analytical and creative capabilities of ASI, solving complex
problems of propulsion, life support, and resource management.
Now that we’ve explored the theoretical potential of AGI and ASI, it’s essential to
understand how AI is currently leveraged in real-world products. AI is already
transforming industries in profound ways, and as an AI PM, your role is central to
making these technologies practical and valuable to users. Let’s take a look at some
examples of groundbreaking AI-powered products and how AI PMs play a crucial
part in their development.
